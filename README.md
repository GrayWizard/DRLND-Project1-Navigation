# Project 1: Navigation - ReadMe

### Introduction

The goal of the project is to train an agent to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world.  

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Instructions

The project requires the installation of the environment provided by Udacity; see the detailed instructions [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd893/parts/6b0c03a7-6667-4fcf-a9ed-dd41a2f76485/modules/4eeb16ab-5ac5-47bf-974d-12784e9730d7/lessons/69bd42c6-b70e-4866-9764-9bfa8c03cdea/concepts/319dc918-bd2c-4d3b-80a5-063bb5f1905a). The following Python 3.5 libraries are required as well (if not provided by the Udacity DRLND environment): `unityagents`,`numpy`,`torch`,`matplotlib`.

After the enviromnent is set up and activated, run `python train_agent.py` to train the agent and `python demo_trained_agent.py` to see how the trained agent performs.
